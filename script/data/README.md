# Source Data

The `.ods` file in this directory was found on the TOCFL website.

I exported each sheet (except the last stats sheet) as a `.csv` ordered from left to right, 1 to 7.

Also included is the CC-CEDICT Chinese dictionary, we use this for English translations and missing character definitions.
