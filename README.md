Modification in progress of https://github.com/tomcumming/tocfl-word-list

Currently running the tocfl-chars.js file is functioning - modified to include [zhuyin (注音)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bopomofo)

# An ordered and extended TOCFL word-list

[The CSV file can be downloaded from here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomcumming/tocfl-word-list/master/dist/tocfl.csv)

[The TSV file (for Anki) can be downloaded from here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomcumming/tocfl-word-list/master/dist/tocfl.tsv)

This list was automatically compiled from the TOCFL word-list spreadsheet.

- It includes all word lists in order of difficulty.
- It adds English translations from [CC-CEDICT](https://cc-cedict.org)
- Includes entries for single characters in composite words that were not included in the original list, composite word entries always come after their contained character entries (look in the file called `tocfl-and-chars.tsv`).

~~To Generate the list for yourself run `npm run start` in this directory.~~
